# Vehicles Dynamics Project
The current repository contains the code developed during Master's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering, for the project of the course "Dynamics of Vehicles" (prof. Francesco Biral).

## Assignment 1
In the first assignment each team has to fit the MF96 tyre model coefficients on a dataset of measured tyre forces for a F-SAE tyre. The specific tyre used for the fitting is "Hoosier 18.0 x 6.0 - 10 R25B".
The main purpose was to obtain acceptable fitting results for different cases: pure longitudinal/lateral forces, combined longitudinal/lateral forces and self aligning moment.

## Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment is the analysis of the steady state behaviour of a F-SAE formula type car. Example data are provided via a Matlab m-file. Using the vehicle dynamic model provided the data have two be adapted according to the provided file and the tyre data fitted in the previous assignment has to be used. 

The vehicle model has to be used to simulate steady state tests such as steer ramp test at constant speed and or speed ramp test at constant steering angle. You have to derive the corresponding normalised axle characteristics, the handling diagram and compar the theoretical with the fitted steering gradients. Additionally the effect of suspension roll stiffness, camber and toe angle effect on steering characteristics have to be analysed.
